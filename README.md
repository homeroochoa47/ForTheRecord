# Django-React Comment Finder

Comment finder is a site that searches for a user's currently playing Spotify track and searches and displays youtube for comments from the most popular video instances for that song. 

This project was inspired by my frequent youtube searches when listening to music. A lot of times I wanted to see what people were saying about a song, and youtube videos are a great way to do that, but I was spending too much time searching for videos with comments enabled, watching ads, and listening to low quality versions of my song. 

Instead, a user can log into their Spotify account on this site and see a list of comments without having to go through the youtube search process. They'll also be able to save comments and songs, and make a nice graphic with comments that they'll be able to share.

There are lots of features I'm interested in adding, such as artist information, lyrics, and a few other interactive components, but those will have to come as I add to the site over time. This is something that will have at least one user (me), so I want to keep adding to this whenever I have the time to work on it.
